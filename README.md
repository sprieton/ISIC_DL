2. **COMPETITION-SPECIFIC RULES**
Grading and Evaluation (70% of Final Grade)

The Kaggle Leaderboard contributes 70% of each student’s competition grade.
Baseline: An AUC score of 85 corresponds to a 5/10.
Best Score on the private leaderboard (among all participants) corresponds to a 10/10.
All other AUC scores between 85 and the best AUC will be linearly normalized to a grade between 5 and 10 as follows (example formula): Grade = 5 + 5*(yourScore - 85) / (Best score - 85)
Where "Best score" is the highest AUC achieved by any competitor.
If your AUC is below 85, your Kaggle-derived score will be below 5 (scaled accordingly).
Presentation (30% of Final Grade)

Each team or individual must perform a presentation covering:
Data Imbalance Handling: Demonstrate awareness and any techniques attempted (if any) to address imbalance. (5%)
Preprocessing & Data Augmentation: Detail relevant pipelines or transformations (if performed). (5%)
Best model: Explain why the model was selected (instead of alternative algorithms). (5%)
Explainability analysis: Discuss how you interpreted or visualized what the model “looks at” (e.g., feature importance, saliency maps). (5%)
Failure to present implies a zero grade in the corresponding 30% portion of the evaluation.
